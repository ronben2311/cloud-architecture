Advanced Kubernetes Project Exercise
In this exercise, you'll create a Kubernetes (K8S) project using Flask as the backend server, 
PostgreSQL as the database, Redis for caching, and a React application as the frontend. 
The project will utilize various K8S components, including ConfigMaps, Secrets, 
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC), Namespaces, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), and NetworkPolicies. 
This exercise is designed to be exciting and challenging, providing you with a comprehensive learning experience.
Project Structure

1. Backend: Flask server with multiple endpoints.

2. Database: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

3. Cache: Redis for caching.

4. Frontend: React application.

5. K8S Components:
   - Pods
   - Deployments
   - Services
   - ConfigMaps
   - Secrets
   - PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
   - Namespace
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
   - NetworkPolicies
   
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Setting Up Flask Backend
1. Create a Flask application (app.py):
   - Set up a basic Flask server.
   - Implement multiple endpoints for data retrieval and data addition.
   - Integrate PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching.
2. Create a requirements.txt:
   - Include Flask, psycopg2, and redis.
3. Create a Dockerfile for the Flask application:
   - Use a Python base image.
   - Install the required dependencies.
   - Copy the application code and run the Flask server.
2. Setting Up PostgreSQL Database
1. Create a postgres-init.sql:
   - Initialize the PostgreSQL database.
   - Create a table and insert initial data.
3. Setting Up React Frontend
1. Create a basic React application (use Create React App for simplicity):
   - Set up a React application with a form to add data and a list to display data from the Flask API.
2. Create a Dockerfile for the React application:
   - Use a multi-stage build to build the React application and serve it using Nginx.
4. Creating Kubernetes Manifests
Create a k8s directory to store all K8S manifests.
1. Namespace:
   - Create a Namespace for the project.
2. ConfigMap for PostgreSQL Initialization Script:
   - Store the initialization script for PostgreSQL.
3. Secret for PostgreSQL Password:
   - Store the PostgreSQL password as a Kubernetes Secret.
4. PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for PostgreSQL:
   - Define PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for PostgreSQL data storage.
5. PostgreSQL Deployment and Service:
   - Deploy PostgreSQL and expose it as a service.
6. Redis Deployment and Service:
   - Deploy Redis and expose it as a service.
7. Flask Deployment and Service:
   - Deploy the Flask application and expose it as a service.
   - Use environment variables to connect to PostgreSQL and Redis.
8. React Deployment and Service:
   - Deploy the React application and expose it as a service.
5. Additional Kubernetes Features
1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):
   - Implement HPA for the Flask deployment to scale based on CPU utilization.
2. NetworkPolicies:
   - Define NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic between pods.
Instructions
1. Set up Minikube:
   - Start a Minikube cluster.
2. Build Docker Images:
   - Build the Docker images for Flask and React applications using Minikubeâ€™s Docker daemon.
3. Apply Kubernetes Manifests:
   - Apply all the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the applications and services.
4. Access the Application:
   - Use Minikube's service command to get the URL for the React application and access it in your browser.
5. Verify Functionality:
   - Test the application by adding data through the React frontend and verifying it through the Flask API.
6. Monitor Scaling:
   - Monitor the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and observe how it scales the Flask deployment based on load.
7. Review NetworkPolicies:
   - Ensure that the NetworkPolicies are correctly restricting traffic between pods.
